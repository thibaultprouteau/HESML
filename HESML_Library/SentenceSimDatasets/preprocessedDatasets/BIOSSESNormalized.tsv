it has recently been shown that craf is essential for kras g12dinduced nsclc	it has recently become evident that craf is essential for the onset of krasdriven nonsmall cell lung cancer
the bcl2 inhibitor abt737 induces regression of solid tumors and its derivatives are in the early clinical phase as cancer therapeutics however it targets bcl2 bclxl and bclw but not mcl1 which induces resistance against apoptotic cell death triggered by abt737	recently it has been reported that abt737 is not cytotoxic to all tumors cells and that chemoresistance to abt737 is dependent on appreciable levels of mcl1 expression the one bcl2 family member it does not effectively inhibit
previous studies demonstrated that the decrease level of 5 hmc in tumors was due to the reduced expression of tet123 and idh2 genes or tumor derived idh1 and idh2 mutations	in addition genetic and functional studies suggest that neomorphic idh mutations contribute to myeloid transformation at least in part by inhibiting tet enzymatic function
more recently idh mutations and resultant 2hydroxyglutarate 2hg production in leukemia cells were reported to induce global dna hypermethylation through impaired tet2 catalytic function	it has also been recently reported that mutations of the isocitrate dehydrogenase genes idh1 and idh2 can lead to the aberrant production of 2hydroxyglutarate 2hg a metabolite that inhibits tet2 enzymatic activity resulting in a hypermethylated promoter phenotype in acute myeloid leukemia aml tumors carrying idh12 mutations
recent in vitro studies using shrnabased approaches have suggested a role for tet2 in regulating myeloid differentiation and in regulating stemprogenitor cell proliferation	two recent studies used rnaimediated tet2 knockdown in vitro to suggest that tet2 depletion led to impaired hematopoietic differentiation and to preferential myeloid commitment
recently it was reported that expression of idh1r132h suppresses tet2 activity and the mutations of idh1 and idh2 genes occur in a mutual exclusive manner with that of tet2 gene in aml	this largescale study showed that idh1idh2 mutations were mutually exclusive with inactivating tet2 mutations suggesting that the two types of mutations had similar effects and were thus functionally redundant
recently it was reported that expression of idh1r132h suppresses tet2 activity and the mutations of idh1 and idh2 genes occur in a mutual exclusive manner with that of tet2 gene in aml	the mechanism was clarified by yet another genomic survey this time involving acute myelogenous leukemia aml
expression of an activated form of ras proteins can induce senescence in some primary fibroblasts	when expressed alone in primary cells however oncogenic ras induces premature senescence a putative tumour suppressor mechanism to protect from uncontrolled proliferation
a high percentage of tumor cells that take on immortalized characteristics show telomerase activity and it has been suggested that htert expression may be one of the six key events common to cancer	as a serinethreonine protein kinase akt functions by phosphorylating key intermediate signaling molecules leading to increased cell metabolism cell growth cell survival and cell invasiveness—all hallmarks of cancer
n view of the evidence that many tumors occurring in nature arise from the selection of cells with genetic andor epigenetic changes	the phenomena of neoplastic development and neoplastic transformation whether they occur in vivo or in vitro are thought to represent the accumulation of a series of genetic and epigenetic alterations that disrupt the normal processes of cell division and tissue integrity
the phenomena of neoplastic development and neoplastic transformation whether they occur in vivo or in vitro are thought to represent the accumulation of a series of genetic and epigenetic alterations that disrupt the normal processes of cell division and tissue integrity	neoplastic development represents cumulative genetic and epigenetic events leading to the emergence of cells that can attain a tumorigenic phenotype
tumorigenesis is a multistage process that involves multiple cell types	previous studies have suggested a number of hallmark functions that need to be acquired for a cancer to generate helping researchers understand the complexity in tumor progression in a way of logical scientific manner
furthermore transiently expressed exogenous lats2 is localized to centrosomes	lats1 and lats2 have been detected on interphase and mitotic centrosomes
since in s cerevisiae dbf2 was shown to be associated with anaphase andor telophase progression we examined whether the deletion of the kinase would also affect cell cycle progression in n crassa	taking into consideration the role that dbf2 homologs have been shown to play in cell cycle progression predominant localization of dbf2 in ncrassa is expected
several computational target prediction approaches such as targetscan pictar miranda pita dianamicrot and rnahybrid have been developed to predict target genes	three programs pictar miranda and targetscan were used to predict the targets of mir21
several lines of evidence suggest that the known principal rb pathway lesions in human tumors act in a mutual exclusive manner	in individual human tumor specimens these principal components of the pathway—rbcdk46p16ink4a—are reported to be targeted in a mutually exclusive manner
the retinoblastoma protein prb was among the first recognized tumor suppressor proteins and loss or repression of prb function is thought to play a causative role in most human cancers	mutation of the retinoblastoma tumor susceptibility gene rb1 is the ratelimiting step in the genesis of retinoblastoma and over 90 of human tumors exhibit reduced prb function
for example loss of or functional alterations in the two major tumor suppressor proteins prb and p53 cause an upregulation of ribosome biogenesis in cancer tissues	e2f1 stabilizes p53 by inducing the expression of p19p14arf an inhibitor of the mdm2 ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for proteolysis
recently mir126 was identified as a metastasis suppressing mirna that is downregulated in relapsing breast cancer leukemia and cervical cancer	subsequent reports showed that mir126 targeted the oncogene irs1 insulin receptor substrate1 in breast cancer cells and mir126 was downregulated in cervical cancer
recently mir126 was identified as a metastasis suppressing mirna that is downregulated in relapsing breast cancer leukemia and cervical cancer	mir155 is upregulated in several human tumors such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia melanoma head and neck squamous cell carcinoma clearcell kidney cancer hepatocellular carcinoma lymphoma thyroid carcinoma breast cancer colon cancer cervical cancer pancreatic cancer and lung cancer
upregulation of mir24 has been observed in a number of cancers including oscc	in addition mir24 is one of the most abundant mirnas in cervical cancer cells and is reportedly upregulated in solid stomach cancers
mir223 seems to be a target molecule of tfs regulating granulopoiesis	feedback loops in which a mirnaregulated transcription factor regulates the transcription of its cognate mirna have been described in a number of animals
furthermore a very recent study demonstrated the mechanism that specifies myeloid expression of mir223 and proposed a unique “minicircuitry” comprised of mir223 and transcription factors nfia and caat enhancerbinding protein α cebpα	mir223 regulates granulopoiesis by a feedback mechanism and is modulated competitively by the transcription factors nuclear factor ia nfia and ccaatenhancer binding proteinα cebpα
mir223 regulates granulopoiesis by a feedback mechanism and is modulated competitively by the transcription factors nuclear factor ia nfia and ccaatenhancer binding proteinα cebpα	there is growing evidence from animal systems that mirnaregulated transcription factors frequently regulate the transcription of their cognate mirnas
in myelopoiesis mir223 has been shown to regulate granulocyte development in both humans and mice	as shown previously mir223 is highly conserved and its myeloidspecific expression is also well characterized in both human and mouse
to clarify the roles of mirnas in erythropoiesis four mirnas were selected mir155 mir221 mir223 and mir451 because their expression seems to be relevant to hematopoiesis	in myelopoiesis mir223 has been shown to regulate granulocyte development in both humans and mice
we then sought to reassess the regulation of mir223 in the exactly same experimental system adopted in the previous work	importantly our reassessment revealed that this conserved promoter is probably active in the induction of mir223 during alltrans retinoic acid atrainduced differentiation of the apl cell line nb4 cells which is the main experimental system adopted in the previous study
unique segments of homologous sequences in rip1 and rip3 rip homotypic interaction motifs rhims were shown to mediate their interaction	rip1 was reported to interact with rip3
this form of necrosis also termed necroptosis requires the activity of receptorinteracting protein kinase 1 rip1 and its related kinase rip3	tnfmediated programmed necrosis typically involves the receptorinteracting serinethreonine kinases 1 and 3 rip1 and rip3 as evidenced in human mouse and zebrafish cell lines as well as in a murine sepsis model
this form of necrosis also termed necroptosis requires the activity of receptorinteracting protein kinase 1 rip1 and its related kinase rip3	moreover other reports have also shown that necroptosis could be induced via modulating rip1 and rip3
furthermore ablation of both erk1 and erk2 impaired tumor development whereas inactivation of either one alone had no effect	only concomitant ablation of erk1 and erk2 impairs tumor growth
importantly the role of erk phosphorylation in krasdriven nsclcs has been recently highlighted by the demonstration that erk activity is essential for krasdriven lung tumorigenesis	as mentioned above high erk activity is crucial for the development of krasdriven nsclcs
lung tumour formation in mice by oncogenic kras requires craf but not braf	the oncogenic activity of mutant kras appears dependent on functional craf  but not on braf
the oncogenic activity of mutant kras appears dependent on functional craf but not on braf	notably craf has recently been found essential for development of krasdriven nsclcs
the oncogenic activity of mutant kras appears dependent on functional craf	oncogenic kras mutations are common in cancer
baf53 and βactin subunits have been implicated in mammalian swisnfregulated binding to the chromatinnuclear matrix	in addition arp4related baf53 and βactin are components of the human swisnf complex and could play a role in its signalregulated binding to the chromatinnuclear matrix
the mammalian arp baf53 brgassociated factor and βactin were initially found as components of the mammalian swisnflike baf chromatinremodeling complex	in addition arp4related baf53 and βactin are components of the human swisnf complex and could play a role in its signalregulated binding to the chromatinnuclear matrix
all known gefs reconfigure the nucleotidebinding pocket often opening it by rearranging the switch regions	a characteristic of gefs is their strong preference for binding nucleotidefree over nucleotideloaded gtpases
in eukaryotic cells small gproteins are critically regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors gefs and gtpase activating proteins gaps	eukaryotic small gproteins are often controlled through the balancing actions of gaps and gefs
in a previous study in a mouse model of krasdependent pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma it was shown that oncogenic kras induces nucleotide biosynthesis largely through the enhancement of the nonoxidative branch of the ppp	previous results showed that oncogenic ras elevates ribonucleotide synthesis largely through the nonoxidative branch of the ppp
importantly rnai knockdown of gfpt1 reduced overall oglcnacylation and blocked krasg12damediated tumor growth in vitro and in vivo	gfpt1 is the ratelimiting enzyme in the hbp and it has been identified as an important contributor to krasdriven pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma pdac
we and others have recently described the induciblekrasp53− ikrasp53− mouse model of pancreatic cancer that allows tissuespecific inducible and reversible expression of mutant kras in combination with a loss of function allele of the tumor suppressor p53	there is a certain variability in these findings for instance metastatic potential has been described by other groups using kc or ikras mice combined with loss of function allele of p53
the overall accuracy of our gene expression classifier was 88 and all tall telaml1positive hyperdiploid and e2arearranged cases were correctly classified ie 100 sensitivity which resembled the data previously reported using other strategies for probe set selection and classifier construction	a gene that warrants further studies is the erythropoietin receptor that is 74fold higher expressed in telaml1positive cases compared to other precursor ball cases confirming other gene expression classification studies
a gene that warrants further studies is the erythropoietin receptor that is 74fold higher expressed in telaml1positive cases compared to other precursor ball cases confirming other gene expression classification studies	another recent gene expression study of large numbers of cases provided support for the hypothesis that distinct leukemias are specified by each of the unique chromosomal abnormalities found in lymphoblastic leukemias
mllfkbp and mllaf9 transformed cells showed persistent expression of hox a7 and hox a9 as well as the hox cofactor meis 1	regardless of the mechanism for transcriptional activation increasing data suggest that hox a7 hox a9 and meis1 are pivotal targets for mll fusion proteinmediated transformation
these findings were identical to the pattern of expression seen in human acute lymphoid and myeloid leukemias with mll rearrangements	these genes are consistently expressed in leukemias with mll rearrangements
mirvec constructs were described before and dnd1 openreading frames were cloned as described into a pcs2based cmv expression vector to contain a double carboxyterminal ha tag	the pmscvblastmir plasmids containing either hsamir376a1 human mirna or control mirna htrhuman telomerase rna were constructed as described previously
for sox11 repression by mir204 neuro2a cells atcc were grown on coverslips in 24well plates for 24 h and then cotransfected with 500 ng of pcaggfp expression plasmid and either 500 ng of scrambledmirvec or mir204mirvec expression plasmid containing the premirna of mir204	cotransfection of mirvecmir204  and the renilla3′ utr plasmid was in hek293t cells with transitlt1 transfection reagent mirus
consequently mirnas have been demonstrated to act either as oncogenes eg mir155 mir17−5p and mir21  or tumor suppressors eg mir34 mir15a mir16−1 and let7	the extent to which mirnas specifically affect metastasis remains unclear as all the mirnas reported to affect metastasis also exert potentially confounding influences on primary tumor development apoptosis andor cell proliferation
consequently mirnas have been demonstrated to act either as oncogenes eg mir155 mir17−5p and mir21 or tumor suppressors eg mir34 mir15a mir16−1 and let7	given the extensive involvement of mirna in physiology dysregulation of mirna expression can be associated with cancer pathobiology including oncogenesis proliferation epithelialmesenchymal transition metastasis aberrations in metabolism and angiogenesis among others
in many tumors there is either overexpression of socalled oncogenic mirnas eg mir155 mir17−5p and mir21  or downregulation of tumor suppressor mirnas eg mir34 mir15a mir16−1 and let7	of note mir373 had been previously identified as a potential oncogene together with mir372 in testicular germcell tumors although it has been proposed that the prometastatic and the oncogenic properties of this mirna are due to the regulation of different genes cd44 and lats2 respectively
to directly measure the effect of endogenous dnd1 on the activity of endogenous mir372 family we used sensor molecules containing the luciferase gene under the control of either wildtype lats23′utr or a mutant in the 372 target sites	the 3′utrs of p27 and connexin43 were pcr amplified from genomic dna and cloned into pgl3 promega downstream of the luciferase gene constructs bearing the lats2 3′utr were described
these models have facilitated the identification of candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes	the development of genomescale libraries of rnai reagents has facilitated lossoffunction approaches in mammalian cells that have identified candidate tumorsuppressor genes
these cells herein termed tlmhmecs are immortal but do not proliferate in the absence of extracellular matrix ecm	hmecs expressing htert and sv40 lt tlmhmecs were cultured in mammary epithelial growth medium megm lonza
ironically rest has recently been described as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene	rest is a transcription factor that represses neuronal genes in nonneural tissues and plays a prominent tumor suppressor role in epithelial tissues
further inpp4b was identified out of a collection of rnais to give rise to anchorageindependent growth in human mammary epithelial cells hmec	on the other hand rasa4capri ras p21 protein activator 4 a suppressor of epithelial cell transformation functions as a ca2dependent ras gtpaseactivating 0protein gap to inactivate the rasmapk pathway following a stimulus that elevates intracellular calcium
alterations in oct4 expression promote differentiation and leads to the specification of ectodermal endodermal or mesodermal primitive progenitors	additionally expression of oct4 and sox2 has been shown to affect early differentiation genes such as sox17 expression
t47d mcf7 skbr3 hela and caco2 cells were transfected by electroporation as described previously	mcf7 or hela cells were electroporated as described previously to more than 95 efficiency with psuper constructs against the various targets and 72 hr later protein expression was analyzed by sdspage and western blotting
it has been shown however that ubiquitination of cyclin d1 can efficiently take place following phosphorylation of another site or without the apparent requirement for phosphorylation	apcdependent degradation of cyclin d1 does not require threonine 286 phosphorylation but the presence of a “cyclin degradation box” however as observed in the present study threonine 286 phosphorylation is essential for proteolytic degradation of cyclin d1 in skin
a few studies have reported the control of apcc by genotoxic stress in mammalian cells ionizing radiation was shown to activate the apcc to degrade cyclin d1 which triggers an immediate p53independent g1 arrest	in fact genotoxic stresses such as ionizing radiation have been demonstrated to trigger rapid proteolysis of cyclin d1 leading to p53independent g1 arrest
as p16ink4a blocks the inactivation of prb by cyclindependent kinases and arf blocks the inactivation of p53 by mdm2mediated proteolysis both have the capacity to cause cell cycle arrest	by inducing arf and ink4a in primary rodent fibroblasts oncogenic ras expression leads to growth arrest and premature senescence
for the analysis of expression at different stages of differentiation data were obtained for 43 mouse samples in stembase originating from 16 studies with affymetrix moe430a microarray chips as used in an oct4 expression profiling study covering murine escs embryonal carcinoma cell lines and several early differentiated lineages	we investigated the patterns of expression of the oct4associated data set in cells at different stages of differentiation including embryonic carcinoma embryonic stem cells embryoid bodies and various differentiated cell types on the basis of transcriptomics data
besides these 28 oct4regulated genes the oct4oetn included 8 more genes of a recently published list of oct4correlated transcripts expressed in escs	almost half 37 of the oct4oetn genes are known oct4 companions in escs as their expression is directly regulated by or correlated with oct4
expression of an activated form of ras proteins can induce senescence in some primary fibroblasts	the senescent state has been observed to be inducible in certain cultured cells in response to high level expression of genes such as the activated ras oncogene
activated ras will transform established lines such as nih3t3 cells it causes a senescencelike growth arrest in primary cells	moreover oncogenes such as hrasv12 provoke a stress response in primary cells that results in an irreversible growth arrest termed premature senescence
oct4dependent transcriptional networks have been described regulating selfrenewal and pluripotency in human and mouse es and ec cells and in human mesenchymal cells	cotransfection of mirvecmir204  and the renilla3′ utr plasmid was in hek293t cells with transitlt1 transfection reagent mirus
this oxidative branch activity is elevated in comparison to many cancer cell lines where the oxidative branch is typically reduced and accounts for 20 of the carbon flow through ppp	the downward laboratory  went all the way from identifying gata2 as a novel synthetic lethal gene to validating it using krasdriven gem models
accordingly expression of mutant kras alone is sufficient to drive malignant progression whereas elimination of mutant kras from established tumors leads to tumor regression	the results of research  represent a very important advance in the longstanding fight to conquer lung cancer
considerable evidence indicates that cancer cells develop dependencies on normal functions of certain genes that can potentially be exploited to improve therapeutic strategies	in the case of cell response to stress cyclin d1 can be degraded through its binding to the anaphasepromoting complex and a rxxl sequence located in the nh2terminal part of the protein
in pc9 cells loss of gata6 andor hopx did not alter cell growth whereas reduction of gata2 and egfr inhibited cell viability as previously reported	it has been shown that the activities of many regulatory factors of checkpoints are lost or arrested during the process of tumorigenesis
a recent study identified the importance of the gata2 transcriptional network in ras oncogenedriven nsclc and suggested effective combinations targeting the proteasome together with il1 and rhosignalling	alternatively the anaphase promoting complex apc is responsible for the rapid degradation of cyclin d1 in cells irradiated with ionizing radiation
the researchers screened human nsclc cell lines carrying either wildtype or mutant kras with an rnai library against 7000 human genes	recently it was shown that gata2 fulfills such role in mutant kras induced nsclc
a number of studies have identified unbiased strategies to treat kras mutant cancers through rna interference screens including inhibition of tak1 stk33 tbk1 wt1 gata2 and bclxlmek	this would also permit the use of inhibitors that target a single normal protein on which in particular the tumor cells depend as the result of a mutation in a defined pathway
finally researchers combined available inhibitors selective for two of the pathways regulated by gata2 to treat mice with krasdriven nsclcs	in pc9 cells loss of gata6 andor hopx did not alter cell growth whereas reduction of gata2 and egfr inhibited cell viability as previously reported
they identified that some genes involved in rhorelated signaling pathways were occupied by gata2 in kras mutant but not wildtype tumor cells	the researchers combined available inhibitors selective for two of the pathways regulated by gata2 to treat mice with krasdriven nsclcs
the in vivo data is still preliminary and other potential roadblocks such as drug resistance have not been examined	the gem model used in this study retains wildtype tp53 suggesting that the tumors successfully treated with bortezomib and fasudil might not be as aggressive as those in most nsclc patients
in spite of these caveats the results of research represent a very important advance in the longstanding fight to conquer lung cancer	we should consider the data of research as an exciting but early step in the long process of drug discovery
here looking for agents that could specifically kill kras mutant cells they found that knockdown of gata2 was synthetically lethal with kras mutation	not surprisingly gata2 knockdown in kras mutant cells resulted in a striking reduction of active gtpbound rho proteins including the downstream rock kinase
in lung tumors traf6 levels can become elevated by several mechanisms	gata2loxlox   sporadic infection of lung cells with adenocre virus gata2 loss induces regression of established tumors
gata2 is also of considerable interest genetic ablation leads to tumor regression in mouse models of adenocarcinoma of the lung and whereas this transcription factor may appear to be the least druggable of targets its role in regulating the proteasome suggested therapeutic approaches that appear very promising	the gata2 transcription factor which is essential for oncogenic krasdependent lung tumor development binds to the traf6 promoter and enhances its expression
baf53 and βactin subunits have been implicated in mammalian swisnfregulated binding to the chromatinnuclear matrix	βactin and actinrelated proteins have been found in the various atpdependent chromatin remodeling complexes
third human wts2 is a phosphorylation target of auroraa kinase and this phosphorylation plays a role in regulating centrosomal localization of hwts2 toji et al 2004	similarly to plk1 auroraa activity is required for the enrichment or localisation of multiple centrosomal factors which have roles in maturation including lats2 22 and cdk5rap2cnn 23 see 10 for a review
changes in mir146a and mir146b expression andor binding have also been implicated in the metastatic and proliferative response associated with the development of papillary thyroid carcinoma ptc and cervical cancer ovarian cancer breast cancer and pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer	additionally loss of lats2 stimulated reduplication an activity comparable to that observed when cyclin e is overexpressed in the absence of p53
we found no obvious effect of lats2depletion on the auroraa kinase activity when monitored by phosphorylation state of thr288 on auroraa 18 fig s2 suggesting that lats2 may be a downstream of auroraa as mentioned in a previous report 8	among them mir143 mir145 and mir34a have been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and mir146a and mir21 to increase cell growth
oct4dependent transcriptional networks have been described regulating selfrenewal and pluripotency in human and mouse es and ec cells and in human mesenchymal cells	one study reports upregulation of this mir as revealed by qrtpcr whereas a sequencing approach and microarray analysis point to a repression of mir133b in tumor tissue
in addition genetic and functional studies suggest that neomorphic idh mutations contribute to myeloid transformation at least in part by inhibiting tet enzymatic function	in addition upregulation of mir24 has also been observed in gastric and cervical cancers
in pc9 cells loss of gata6 andor hopx did not alter cell growth whereas reduction of gata2 and egfr inhibited cell viability as previously reported	auroraa is required for the correct localisation and function of centrosomal components like centrosomin ndel1 lats and tacc proteins
centrosomes increase both in size and in microtubulenucleating capacity just before mitotic entry	functional studies showed that when introduced into cell lines mir146a was found to promote cell proliferation in cervical cancer cells which suggests that mir146a works as an oncogenic mirna in these cancers
with respect to lats2 it has been reported that lats2 induces g2m arrest and subsequent apoptotic cell death	the expression of mir146a has been found to be upregulated in papillary thyroid carcinoma anaplastic thyroid cancer  and cervical cancer
the upregulation of mir146a was also detected in cervical cancer tissues	similarly to plk1 auroraa activity is required for the enrichment or localisation of multiple centrosomal factors which have roles in maturation including lats2 and cdk5rap2cnn
necroptosis is also part of host defense against virus infection	necrotic death was augmented when caspase activities were compromised by either viral or chemical inhibitors
necrotic death was augmented when caspase activities were compromised by either viral or chemical inhibitors	intriguingly in the presence of caspase inhibitors or following caspase8 gene ablation death receptors have also recently been shown to induce necrotic cell death a process which is dependent on the kinase activity of ripk1 and ripk3
the cyclindependent kinase cdk inhibitor roscovitine has been reported to downregulate the antiapoptotic protein mcl1	recent work in model systems and acute myelogenous leukemia has suggested that expression of mcl1 is a key determinant of resistance to abt737
the upregulation of mir146a was also detected in cervical cancer tissues	the expression of mir146a has been found to be upregulated in cervical cancer
at the onset of mitosis lats2 is activated by phosphorylation and plays important roles in g2m transition in cultured cells	lats2kpm is homologous to lats1 and undergoes cell cycledependent phosphorylation
ironically rest has recently been described as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene	in human epithelial cells rest has been described as a potent suppressor of malignant transformation and its deregulation has been associated with several nonneural tumors including breast and small cell lung cancers
alterations in oct4 expression promote differentiation and leads to the specification of ectodermal endodermal or mesodermal primitive progenitors	oct4 a transcript of pou5f1 plays a role in maintaining stem cell pluripotency selfrenewal and chromatin structure in stem cells and promotes tumor growth in a dosedependent manner
three programs pictar miranda and targetscan were used to predict the targets of mir21	the genes that decreased 2fold or more were further screened for possible mir3723 target sites using a local version of the targetscan algorithm
the recent reports demonstrated that the first eight nucleotides of the 5′ end of mirna could correlate with the efficient translational repression	mismatches near the 5′ end of the small rna completely abrogated translational suppression
oncogenic kras mutations are common in cancer	notably craf has recently been found essential for development of krasdriven nsclcs
