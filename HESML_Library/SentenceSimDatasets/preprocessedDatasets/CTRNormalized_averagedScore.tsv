the is5 element supplies two fnr consensus sites at positions 2925 and 2131 which could serve as the fnr regulatory sites of dcuc	due to this situation the fnr 1 consensus site fig 1 could be used for fnrdependent regulation of dcuc and dcuc as well
in this case the is5 element would cause increased dcuc expression by indirect effects eg topological changes at the dcuc promoter	alternatively other upstream fnr regulatory sites could be used in dcuc and dcuc
this would mean that the is5 element is able to provide fnr regulatory sites if inserted at appropriate positions	in any case insertion of an is5 element is able to increase fnrdependent expression or to place genes under fnr control
in any case insertion of an is5 element is able to increase fnrdependent expression or to place genes under fnr control	is5 elements frequently have been identiﬁed in or at promoters with altered expression of anaerobic pathways genes in e coli 2 14 20
is5 elements frequently have been identiﬁed in or at promoters with altered expression of anaerobic pathways genes in e coli 2 14 20	is5 therefore could be important for the evolution of anaerobic pathways either by inserting new regulatory sites or by changing the quality of adjacent promoters by affecting dna topology
it is synthesized only in the absence of oxygen and nitrate and in the presence of c4 dicarboxylates 4 6 7 27	dcua is expressed constitutively in aerobic and anaerobic growth and can substitute for dcub 7 22
these ﬁndings suggest a different physiological role for dcuc and use under different conditions	to obtain a clue as to the role of dcuc the functions of dcu and the conditions for dcu synthesis were studied
the resulting 05kb dna fragment was cloned into the smai and bamhi sites of pjl29 to create plasmid pmw122	the gene fusions were transferred to the genome of e coli mc4100 with phage lrz5 1 17 21
transport of c4dicarboxylates in cell suspensions of bacteria was measured by silicone oil centrifugation	for measurement of exchange the bacteria were loaded with succinate and the uptake of 14c fumarate was measured by silicone oil centrifugation 5 22 26
the conditions for dcuc expression were studied with a dcuc99lacz reporter gene fusion fig 1	the dcuc gene was fused in frame to 9lacz to obtain a translational protein fusion
the dcuc gene was fused in frame to 9lacz to obtain a translational protein fusion	the fusion contained the complete promoter region up to position 2971 and seven codons of dcuc
the fusion contained the complete promoter region up to position 2971 and seven codons of dcuc	the dcuc99lacz fusion was inserted with phage lrz5 into the genome of e coli mc4100 and monolysogenic strains were used table 2
malate aspartate asparagine and tartrate stimulated expression in a manner similar to that of fumarate data not shown whereas other carboxylic acids including malonate did not cause induction	when glucose was replaced during anaerobic growth by glycerol or other c sources the expression of dcuc increased only negligibly indicating that dcuc is not subject to glucose repression table 2
when glucose was replaced during anaerobic growth by glycerol or other c sources the expression of dcuc increased only negligibly indicating that dcuc is not subject to glucose repression table 2	transcriptional regulators controlling dcuc expression
transcriptional regulators controlling dcuc expression	the expression of dcuc99lacz in mutants deﬁcient in regulators responding to electron acceptors was studied table 2
the expression of dcuc99lacz in mutants deﬁcient in regulators responding to electron acceptors was studied table 2	the fnr mutant lacking the o2responsive regulator fnr was completely devoid of dcuc99lacz expression during aerobic and anaerobic growth
the fnr mutant lacking the o2responsive regulator fnr was completely devoid of dcuc99lacz expression during aerobic and anaerobic growth	the arca mutant which is deﬁcient in the o2responsive regulator arca 9 showed only a twofold decrease in dcuc99lacz expression under anaerobic conditions
the arca mutant which is deﬁcient in the o2responsive regulator arca 9 showed only a twofold decrease in dcuc99lacz expression under anaerobic conditions	therefore anaerobic induction of dcuc is affected by both regulators but fnr plays the major role
mutants lacking the fumarate response regulator dcur dcur gene or the related citb response regulator citb gene 27 showed the same fumarate stimulation of dcuc expression as the wild type	thus fumarate stimulation of dcuc must be affected by a different regulatory system
the lack of glucose repression suggests that dcuc plays a role in glucose fermentation eg succinate efﬂux when only the constitutive dcua carrier is produced as well	accordingly the low rates of transport of dcuc are sufﬁcient for succinate export during fermentation up to 02 mol of succinatemol of glucose but not for fumaratesuccinate exchange in fumarate respiration
the expression of dcuc was not signiﬁcantly inhibited by glucose assigning a role to dcuc during glucose fermentation	the inactivation of dcuc increased fumaratesuccinate exchange and fumarate uptake by dcua and dcub suggesting a preferential function of dcuc in succinate efﬂux during glucose fermentation
when dcub was inactivated in the strains exchange and uptake activities for c4dicarboxylates decreased about two to sixfold compared to those in the parental strains	this result is in agreement with the important role of dcub in these transport reactions of anaerobically growing e coli
this result is in agreement with the important role of dcub in these transport reactions of anaerobically growing e coli	however when dcuc was inactivated exchange and uptake activities increased compared to those in the parental strains
however when dcuc was inactivated exchange and uptake activities increased compared to those in the parental strains	the surprising ﬁnding that inactivation of a carrier increased exchange and uptake activities for the same substrates can be explained by assuming that dcuc counteracts the exchange and uptake activities effected by dcua and dcub and that dcuc preferentially acts as an efﬂux carrier in e coli cells
the inactivation of dcuc increased fumaratesuccinate exchange and fumarate uptake by dcua and dcub suggesting a preferential function of dcuc in succinate efﬂux during glucose fermentation	upon overexpression in a dcuc promoter mutant dcuc dcuc was able to compensate for dcua and dcub in fumaratesuccinate exchange and fumarate uptake
the dcua dcub double mutant grows only slowly on glycerol plus fumarate 22 26	from the double mutant a spontaneous mutant which had regained full anaerobic growth on glycerol plus fumarate was obtained
the expression of dcuc in the mutant dcuc was determined with a dcuc 99lacz fusion	the expression of dcuc 99lacz was increased by a factor of about 22 compared to that in the wild type but the responses to oxygen nitrate and the regulators fnr narl and narp were comparable to those in the wild type data not shown
in wildtype e coli dcuc supports only slow growth by fumarate respiration 26	by using the dcuc mutant we tested whether this ﬁnding was due to restricted functioning of dcuc in the antiport mode or to limiting transport rates
in fig 2 the fumaratesuccinate antiport activities in strains containing only dcuc or dcuc are related to the rates of growth on glycerol plus fumarate	the increase in fumaratesuccinate antiport in the dcuc strain about twofold compared to that in the strain containing only dcuc was similar to the increase in dcuc or dcuc expression and was paralleled by a similar increase in the rate of growth on glycerol plus fumarate
the transcriptional start sites of dcuc and dcuc were determined with mrna isolated from strains carrying either dcuc or dcuc	in primer extension experiments transcripts of the same length were produced from the mrnas of both strains fig 3 and started 116 bp upstream of the supposed translational start sites 26
in dcuc the transcriptional start site is preceded by two potential fnr consensus sites and one halfsite between positions 2335 and 21155	therefore dcuc lacks a typical fnr binding site at position 2415 class ii site 8 11
it seems likely that nikr senses high concentrations of nickel through interactions of this metal with its cterminal domain	indeed a fragment corresponding to the cterminal domain of e coli nikr stably folds in solution is a monomer and binds nickel pt chivers rt sauer unpubl
the baa motif is only 45 50 residues in length and contains no residues that are absolutely conserved	the pairwise identity between sequences of members of different subfamilies is generally only 10 to 15 with only a few cases in which identities are 20 table 4
in the cocrystal structures of arc copg and metj each ribbonhelixhelix dimer binds to a dna site of 8 10 bp and residues from the bsheet mediate most of the sequence specific contacts with dna bases in the major groove somers phillips 1992 raumann et al 1994b gomisrüth et al 1998	dimers can bind cooperatively to adjacent dna subsites although the regions of each protein used for these cooperative protein protein interactions are different
thermal melts were performed with 125 mm protein in s buffer using a 1 min equilibration time and a 30 s averaging time for each 1 8c temperature increment	guhcl melts were performed with a stirred 2 ml solution of 625 mm protein in s buffer from which aliquots were removed and replaced with an equal volume of 625 mm protein in s buffer plus 6 m guhcl

samples from footprinting experiments were run on 8 polyacrylamide gels containing 83 m urea and 1 3 tbe	gels were exposed to a phosphor screen overnight and traces of the footprints were obtained using a phosphorimager and the image quant 50 program molecular dynamics sunnyvale california
the arc structure scored highest against four of the five nikr nterminal domain sequences and was the second highest hit for the remaining sequence although the statistical significance of these scores was borderline table 2	nevertheless both profile searches and structure prediction suggest that nikr is a member of the ribbonhelixhelix protein family
mutation of a residue predicted to be important for dnabinding reduces operator affinity but does not affect the secondary structure or stability of the protein	keywords nickel permease protein folding repressor sequence homology sequence profile structure prediction
in equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation the nterminal domain sedimented with a mean molecular weight of 115 kda close to the value expected for a dimer of 64 kda subunits fig 4	the secondary structure of the nikr nterminal domain was lost in a cooperative fashion in both thermal and guhcl denaturation fig 3b c
these results confirm that the nterminal domain of nikr is responsible for dna recognition	in preliminary experiments we have also found that a subset of mutations within the dna region protected by the nterminal domain reduce the affinity of nikr for the operator data not shown
primer extension analysis in the strain ecl4010 f adhe99lacz 291 showed that as expected the transcriptional start site was at position 2188 fig 3	the results taken together suggest that the downstream transcriptional start site 2188 can be functional by itself and that the promoter region in this fragment contains the necessary structure for response to redox regulation
similar results were obtained when the protein fusions were used data not shown	we also determined the adhe activity levels in cell extracts of these two strains grown under aerobic or anaerobic conditions and found the results concordant with the bgalactosidase activity levels data not shown
the reduction of acetylcoenzyme a coa to ethanol is essential for disposing of excess reducing equivalents by escherichia coli when respiratory pathways fail to maintain redox balance	for instance genetic blockage of the ethanol pathway prevents fermentative growth on glucose or mannitol as a sole carbon and energy source
the narl box comprises two heptamer inverted repeats tacyymt where y is c or t and m is a or c separated by 2 bases 8	sequence scanning revealed a putative site tacccagn2gtgagta located between positions 2199 and 2213 from the translational start site differing from the consensus in only 1 base in each heptamer fig 1
the twostep reduction of acetylcoa to ethanol is catalyzed by a bifunctional enzyme encoded by the adhe gene fig 1 located at 279 min 7 10 13 16 21 24	in addition this protein also functions as a deactivase of pyruvateformate lyase 13 14
we found that in the wildtype background the increase in activity level occurred abruptly at the onset of stationary phase fig 4 top left panel	in the fnr tn10 rpos1 background there was a sixfold increase in activity at the onset of stationary phase od600 20 but the levels reproducibly dropped 50 afterwards possibly resulting from speciﬁc protein degradation in the absence of fnrpromoted synthesis fig 4 top right panel
in the fnr tn10 rpos1 background there was a sixfold increase in activity at the onset of stationary phase od600 20 but the levels reproducibly dropped 50 afterwards possibly resulting from speciﬁc protein degradation in the absence of fnrpromoted synthesis fig 4 top right panel	by contrast in the fnr1 rpos kan background there was no increase in the activity level until the culture was 5 h into the stationary phase eventually reaching ﬁve times that found in the exponentialphase cells fig 4 bottom left panel
it appears that the relatively early increase in the enzyme activity level in the fnr tn10 rpos1 cells reﬂected rpos transcriptional activation following the onset of stationary phase whereas the relatively late increase in the enzyme activity level in the fnr1 rpos kan cells reﬂected fnr transcriptional activation in gradual response to anoxia	this interpretation is consistent with the ﬁnding of a low level of bgalactosidase activity throughout the growth cycle in the fnr tn10 rpos kan double mutant fig 4 bottom right panel
since the rpos effect was unexpected we tested whether a similar inﬂuence was exerted by the regulator on the fulllength promoter	we found that strain ecl4013 f adhelacz 656 also exhibited a 10fold increase in the bgalactosidase activity level during stationary phase
in further support of the rbs occlusion model we found that when the lacz open reading frame possessing its own rbs was placed sufﬁciently downstream of the adhe rbs as in the case of the f adhelacz 656 operon fusion fig 2a the synthesis of bgalactosidase also became rnase iii independent compare strain ecl4013 with strain ecl4017	as expected the bgalactosidase activity level speciﬁed by the f adhelacz 656 protein fusion in which the translation of lacz depended on the adhe rbs fig 2f remained rnase iii dependent compare strain ecl4012 with strain ecl4016
quantitative evidence for the silencing of the downstream start site by the upstream start region	two approaches were designed to test the hypothesis that the upstream promoter region up to position 2656 acts as a silencer of downstream transcription
two approaches were designed to test the hypothesis that the upstream promoter region up to position 2656 acts as a silencer of downstream transcription	first if the downstream promoter is ordinarily not contributing to the net transcription of adhe then a f adhelacz fusion containing the 2292 but not the 2188 transcriptional start site should express lacz at an undiminished level
when grown aerobically this strain showed a bgalactosidase activity level 60 lower than that of the strain bearing the f adhelacz 656 operon fusion with the wildtype promoter sequence	when grown anaerobically strain ecl4054 f adhelacz 656tata did not show an increase in bgalactosidase activity data not shown conﬁrming that even the presence of a nonfunctional upstream promoter region prevents transcription from position 2188
the accumulation of reducing equivalents possibly the nadh concentration or the nadhnad ratio was suggested to be a signal for transcriptional regulation of adhe 5 15	three transcriptional proteins involved in the control of adhe expression have been identiﬁed but none of them is directly responsible for redox regulation
there may well be other acquired biochemical functions yet to be discovered	for instance we do not yet know the biological signiﬁcance of spirosome structures arising from the adhe molecules 13 14
the key enigma highlighted by this study is the presence of two transcriptional start sites in the adhe promoter	the actual existence of the transcript starting at position 2188 in cell extracts 1 and the ability of fnr to activate the anaerobic expression of the 59truncated f adhelacz 291 fusion suggest that under certain conditions the silencer effect of the upstream promoter region can be lifted to allow signiﬁcant transcription at the 2188 site
the second protein cra for catabolite repressor activator represses adhe expression 19 but this transcriptional regulator is functional only when complexed with fructose1phosphate or fructose1 6 bisphosphate as an effector for a review see reference 22	the third protein fis for factor for inversion stimulation 9 28 is required for adhe transcription but fis is not known to require any effector for function and the expression of the ﬁs gene itself is independent of the respiratory condition of growth 18
it was suggested that intramolecular base pairing occludes the rbs ribosomal binding site and that cleavage of the obstructing secondary structure liberates the translation	the results of primer extension experiments indicated two putative adhe transcriptional start sites one at position 2292 and the other at position 2188 from the translational start codon atg 1
the results of primer extension experiments indicated two putative adhe transcriptional start sites one at position 2292 and the other at position 2188 from the translational start codon atg 1	however the mrna starting at position 2188 was not seriously considered for three reasons i the primer extension might be prematurely terminated by a secondary structure of the fulllength adhe mrna ii the short transcript starting at position 2188 might be a breakdown product and iii transcription from this site was not likely to require rnase iii cleavage as predicted by the rbs occlusion model
strains culture conditions and reagents	the relevant characteristics and sources of the bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are given in table 1
in this study we show by using several different transcriptional and translational fusions to the lacz gene that both putative transcriptional start sites can be functional and each site can be redox regulated	although both start sites are narl repressible in the presence of nitrate fnr activates only the 2188 start site and fis is required for the transcription of only the 2292 start site
to construct ladhop2656 operon fusion primers 26565 59agcgagatccacaagataatggcc39 and 26563 59a gctggatccgtaagcaagattactcacttctggg39 were used to amplify a 03kb dna fragment comprising a segment from position 2656 to position 2190 from the adhe translational start site	to construct ladhop3656 operon fusion primers 36565 59agcggatccacaagataatggcc39 and 36563 59cgctggatcccattatagctaacagttaataaattgtagtatg39 were used to amplify a 04kb dna fragment comprising a segment from position 2656 to position 2267 from the adhe translational start site
in addition it was discovered that rpos activates adhe transcription at both start sites	under all experimental conditions tested however only the upstream start site is active
the cultures were then pelleted suspended in 25 ml of z buffer 20 and kept on ice	speciﬁc bgalactosidase activity in cells permeabilized with chloroform and sodium dodecyl sulfate was assayed at 28 °c and is expressed in miller units dod420 per minute per od600 unit 20
under all experimental conditions tested however only the upstream start site is active	available evidence indicates that under those conditions the upstream promoter region acts as a silencer of the downstream transcriptional start site
to test whether the downstream transcriptional start site was functional we constructed two pairs of adhelac fusions differing in the lengths of their promoter regions i a f adhelacz 656 operon fusion and a f adhe99lacz 656 protein fusion extending to position 2656 from the translational start site fig 2a and f and ii a f adhelacz 291 operon fusion and a f adhe99lacz 291 protein fusion extending to position 2291 from the translational start site fig 2b and g	the pair of long fusions contained both the 2292 and 2188 transcriptional start sites whereas the pair of short fusions contained only the 2188 transcriptional start site
translation of the mrna starting at 2292 but not the one starting at 2188 requires rnase iii	the results support the previously postulated ribosomal binding site rbs occlusion model according to which rnase iii cleavage is required to release the rbs from a stemloop structure in the long transcript
in summary the results presented here indicate that arca and fnr regulatory proteins play a role in repression of the e coli tpx gene under anaerobic growth conditions	the dual control of tpx gene expression regulated by arca and fnr proteins appears to provide maximum protection against the toxicity of oxidative stress during aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions
in the present work we analyse the in vivo roles of the two sites bound by fnr in vitro within the cydab promoter region by examining the effects of point mutations created in each site on the expression of the cydab promoters	the results below indicate that i the cydab operon is transcribed from a complex element containing three other promoters in addition to the two previously identified cotter et al 1997 ii promoters p1 p2 p3 and p4 are coordinately regulated by oxygen arca and fnr iii the p5 promoter is not strongly regulated and provides a significant fraction of the total cydab transcription in aerobiosis iv the fnr2 site is essential for anaerobic repression of the four regulated promoters and in particular an intact right halfsite is required for proper recognition by fnr v the fnr1 site plays an auxiliary role in the repression of p1 p3 and p4 but not p2
fifthly a small reduction up to 16fold in anaerobic cyd ± lacz expression was observed for several fnr site mutants in a dfnr background suggesting that some of the mutations may also have fnrindependent effects on gene expression	finally these fnrindependent effects may result from altered arca activation rather than from altered basal promoter activity as none of the fnr site mutations altered cyd ± lacz expression in wildtype cells grown in the presence of oxygen or in an anaerobically grown darca strain data not shown
we also found that bsn27 and mwk6 showed similar clya activity on blood agar table 3 and quantiﬁed lytic activity using the erythrocyte assay data not shown	this was in accordance with overproduction of slya in the hns clya luxab strain jon34pjon22 data not shown in the hns strain jon31pjon22 and in the hns slya strain mwk6pjon22 table 3 which did not result in an additive effect on clya expression compared with the control strains jon34pacyc177 jon31pacyc177 and mwk6 pacyc177
in addition the overexpression of slya in the hns strain jon31pjon22 the hns clya luxab strain jon34pjon22 and the hns slya strain mwk6pjon22 did not result in a further elevation of clya expression	based on our ﬁndings demonstrating no absolute requirement of slya for clya expression but rather a copy number effect we suggest that slya may not be involved speciﬁcally in the natural regulation of clya
the observed regulatory effects on clya with slya and likely also mpra may well be of a more general nature eg competing with hns binding at the clya locus	it has been suggested that slyarelated proteins play key roles in the global regulation of diverse aspects of bacterial physiology 57
in contrast the altered crp binding site that matched the consensus more closely resulted in substantially increased clya expression in crp1 but not crp strains	these ﬁndings supported a model in which the clya promoter is dependent on crp for efﬁcient expression and where the predicted dna site for crp is important for this regulation
this was in contrast to the lack of effect of molybdate addition to this strain	similarly the addition of tungstate to the growth medium for strain tl28 modc gave rise to enhanced moa expression however molybdate addition was without effect
it is noteworthy that the e coli strain mg1665 contained a mata transcript but we failed to amplify a matbc rna from this strain	methylation was started by adding dms to a ﬁnal concentration of 10 mm and proceeded for 5 min at 37 °c
they reported that deletion of three known mdr pump genes acrab mdfa and emre and three omf genes tolc yjcp and yohg resulted in strains with increased susceptibility to some compounds	one of these transformants was the source of plasmid pcy2 16
plasmids designated puv12 and puv16 have been described elsewhere vogel and jensen 1994 and are shown in fig 1	we also found that dps copurified with ychf by western blotting most likely due its small size but not by ms thus it is currently unknown whether ychf specifically interacts with dps and if so whether this interferes with dps activity
the initial step in dna ligation involves formation of a covalent enzymeadenylate intermediate	also both halfsites of the fnr recognition sequence at dmsa are required for fnrdependent expression and are similar in their ability to activate dmsa transcription

we conﬁrmed that transcription of qsebc was activated by the ai2 quorumsensing system fig 1 but we do not know whether the presence of ai2 has any effect on the phosphorylation state of these proteins which is one of the questions we intend to address in the future	the etk homologues include wzc an etklike protein in ecoli k12 that is involved in the production of a colanic acid capsule stevenson et al 1996 orf6 of kpneumoniae which is required for the formation of a k2 capsule arakawa et al 1995 amsa of eamylovora which is required for amylovoran production bugert and geider 1995 epsb of rsolannacearum which is needed for the production of epsi cook and sequeira 1991 and exop of rmeliloti which is needed for production of succinoglycan becker et al 1993 figure 1 data not shown
the addition of nitrate caused a modest reduction in napf gene expression table 2	the maximum level of frdalacz and dmsalacz expression occurred within 200 min and decreased by 20 and 40 respectively from the peak activities fig 4
region 23 rich in aromatic residues is implicated in dna melting and maps in both cases very close to the unpaired segment of the nontemplate strand	as a result ompr is now able to occupy the activating sites upstream of ompc leading to the expression of ompc
we believe that our assignment is the most likely to be correct because all of the available s enterica serovar sequences have an additional base inserted upstream of the atg and thus the other putative upstream initiation codons are out of frame with the fade coding sequence	whether this structural gene segment or any other is involved in metabolic control of zwf expression will await genetic analysis eg using the zwflacz protein fusions described here
the amounts of mrnas were quantitated by densitometry and plotted with that of p2tacr taken as one	the other five regulators have also been recognized as global in either one or two of the three studies
the increase in fur levels may also be required for increased repression of iron uptake	another factor not included in the model that could contribute to reducing resistance development is the effect of fosfomycin on bacterial adhesion to epithelial cells

the transcription of the mara gene is regulated by the repressor marr alekshun and levy 1997	since we could demonstrate class iii promoter activity and assembly of the final filament in hms174 de3 lt7 figure 6 the late class iii flic gene and the flidst operon were deleted which was expected to increase flgm secretion
lim et al 20 found the same phenomenon when substituting for the adenine at 11 of the gal promoter	the positions that were found to be very strongly conserved in the two previous compilations show a lower degree of conservation in the current compilation in all space groups
the fulllength fsufi fdnh precursor was present throughout the timescale of the experiment fig 4c and e thus we conclude that processing of the fsufi fdnh chimera is like the native sufi precursor fig 4a and e stanley et al 2000 completely dependent upon translocation to the periplasm by the tat system and subsequent exposure to signal peptidase in that compartment	therefore the nhaa expression is dependent on the genetic background of strains used
it is even more surprising that e coli cells containing only these hybrid ribosomes grow nearly as well as those containing pure e coli ribosomes	in the resulting construct the rpoh promoter region is ﬂanked by an upstream ecori site and a downstream xbai site
it is even more surprising that e coli cells containing only these hybrid ribosomes grow nearly as well as those containing pure e coli ribosomes	moreover the or roles played by chew and the mcps are different
ten thousand cells were inoculated with the microplanter mit60p sakuma seisakusyo tokyo japan a specially designed device for mic determination and incubated at 37 °c for 16 h	whether this structural gene segment or any other is involved in metabolic control of zwf expression will await genetic analysis eg using the zwflacz protein fusions described here
these twocomponent systems consist of an oxidoreductase providing fmnh2 for the oxygenation reaction catalyzed by the second component	negative control is exerted by cra on a number of operons involved in glycolysis permitting derepression of the glycolytic pathways by f1p andor f16p2 in the presence of exogenous sixcarbon compounds
these twocomponent systems consist of an oxidoreductase providing fmnh2 for the oxygenation reaction catalyzed by the second component	this creates some difficulty in cataloguing genes that are adapted to colonizing niches versus freeliving it is rarely certain whether an apparently freeliving species never colonizes a higher organism or is not part of a continuum of strains frequently exchanging lifestyle genes

in contrast to the laci the galr tetramer is likely to have a rather rigid vshaped structure that is formed via stacking interactions of two galr dimers with relatively weak afﬁnity for each other 1819 these properties restrict the conditions eg phasing and spatial separation of operators along dna presence or absence of hu negative superhelicity etc in which the bound galr dimers are able to form a loop	if this idea is correct it should be possible to identify the cellular proteins that interact with each of the two domains by the use of targeted genetic and biochemical approaches
in the cultures insoluble sediments were observed as cell growth progressed suggesting that the growth inhibition resulted in cell lysis	we would like to point out that tfasta analysis of sdar yielded a high percentage of identity 959 in a 170aminoacid overlap with some protein sequences encoded in homo sapiens chromosome 5
therefore although we can not rule out the possibility that the dbpa used in our assays is active as an atpase but not as a helicase we suggest that dbpa in fact does not unwind rna in vitro	the cpxr locus was inactivated in a similar fashion to cpxa
therefore although we can not rule out the possibility that the dbpa used in our assays is active as an atpase but not as a helicase we suggest that dbpa in fact does not unwind rna in vitro	the angle of c8 was trans for trans hemimethylated dna and spanned the gauche to trans range for cis hemimethylated dna

the occupancy of the poles appeared to involve minc located at the membrane as indicated by the clearly observed arcs or horseshoes of ¯ uorescence that outlined the poles	expression and redox regulation of f adhelacz 291 operon and protein fusions bearing only the 2188 transcriptional start site
since a mutation in this gene affected opg synthesis in e coli see below ydcg was renamed mdod and its product was designated opgd	the h461s and r520stop mutations are furthest from the tpp cofactor and their improved activities are more likely due to steric effects at the activesite entrance
thus the export defect of ompa caused by secb deﬁciency is not as severe as other secbdependent precursors such as mbp maltose binding protein and lamb 20 27	to assay for coimmunoprecipitation c rodentium was grown at 37 °c to mid log phase in dmem sigma and harvested 10000 g 15 min 4 °c
the induced enzyme activity of the wildtype strain reached its maximal level at 90 min fig 2 x while the activity of the rpos mutant kept rising and reached a threefold increase over the wildtype at 210 min fig 2	each plasmid was transformed into e coli strain p90cm15
there is no indication of any gene other than flie within the flie operon consistent with the genetic conclusion that it is monocistronic 20	redox cofactors were mostly present in an oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad form and nad level was maintained or slightly increased during the fermentation in wildtype and most of mutant cells
the results were similar to those obtained at 6 °c except that at all malt concentrations tested the apparent molecular mass of the major peak was higher at 20 than at 6 °c figs 6 and 7	polymix buffer contained 5 mm magnesium acetate 5 mm ammonium chloride 95 mm potassium chloride 05 mm calcium chloride 8 mm putrescine 1 mm spermidine 5 mm potassium phosphate 1 mm dithioerythritol jelenc kurland 1979
in our model system the flanking atrich dna determines the directionality of the cisspreading transcriptionally repressive hns filament structure toward the promoter of the target gene leuo	rnap 43 g andor s10 550 ng in a total volume of 20 1 was incubated for 5 min at 37 followed by chromatography on a 05ml column containing biogel a1 5 m biorad in 10 mm hepes ph 7 20 mm mgso4 and 75 mm nh 4 acetate
the mass of the purified gluput was measured by fast atom bombardment fab mass spectrometry model jeoljms600 jeol tokyo japan using glycerol as a matrix	under these conditions ihf has both negative and positive effects on fnrdependent activation due to its binding at the ihf i and ihf iii sites
the mass of the purified gluput was measured by fast atom bombardment fab mass spectrometry model jeoljms600 jeol tokyo japan using glycerol as a matrix	therefore it is not surprising that the orientation of oi can have an effect on repression as well as on promoter strength
these fall into two broad classes selfsplicing introns and cisregulatory elements in the untranslated regions utrs	the role of crp as an activator of transcription particularly its ability to direct different kinetic mechanisms of activation from different classes of regulatory binding sites has been the subject of intense interest cf ref
why has e coli maintained two apparently redundant nitrate reductase enzymes	neither arginine nor nacetylornithine at 30 mm inhibited pca reductase activity
the fosfomycin sensitivity assay gave intermediate results indicating that several of the substitutions outside the 64 element reduced uhpa binding	phage plating efficiency was measured with wildtype x phage infecting the same irradiated bacterial culture
previous studies of the regulation of pii activity by the effector 2ketoglutarate have suggested that the trimeric pii may exist in multiple states depending on its degree of saturation by 2ketoglutarate fig 3	an examination of this deletion set revealed that 8026 and 8030 made the largest deletions into the left cap recognition sequence three of the five base pairs of tctga were deleted
the lsr acdbfg ec mutant showed much slower removal of ai2 from extracellular ﬂuids relative to the wild type when grown in the absence of glucose fig 5a although the removal of ai2 was not completely blocked	thermodynamic analysis of corepressor binding to biotin repressor the results of kinetic measurements of adenylate binding have in addition to allowing estimates of the thermodynamic stability of the complex revealed information related to the mechanism of allosteric activation of the protein for dna binding at the level of the monomer
we found that the ﬂoated outer membrane fraction in fact contains seqa protein and is active for sequestration ﬁgure 3	survival of uv irradiated cells was measured by plating on lb containing ampicillin 20 pgml as described by otsuji et al 1974
the second crpprotected site designated site 2 extends from about bp 2131 to 2158 and contains 12 bp that match base pairs in the 22bp consensus crp binding site fig 1	the induction ratios of the idnd and idnk promoters were remarkably similar indicating that transcription from the divergent promoters is in fact coordinated table 4
instead these global control mechanisms serve to adjust the basal level or capacity for operon expression with changes in dna supercoiling that reflect the growth conditions of the cell	in all of its key features this model is analogous to the proposed mechanism for pyrimidinemediated regulation of codba expression 34
phosphate pi depletion was carried out by a modi ® cation of the method previously described atlung and bronsted 1994	following ems mutagenesis a mutant was isolated which was defective in the latter property see materials and methods
in reaction 2 reduction of as v to as iii is achieved by one electron donated by the thiolate of 12 cys of arsc and another electron derived from the thiolate of gsh	the crystallographic data for ccbl were processed in space group c2221
the procedures for growing cells have been described celis 1977	as can be seen from table 3 the mutator genes and mutagens as well greatly influence the phenotypic pattern of arg revertants
proteins were stained with ponceau red and the major 40 kda band was excised	e coli is therefore likely to experience considerable stress in the early stages of hyperosmotic shock a situation that should lead to the activation of additional stress responses
transcription attenuation mechanisms rely on rna	a better understanding of the mechanism of the mismatch repair system would help in elucidating this problem
the major bands found were a fulllength transcript and some shorter products representing a stop at the 39 end of the stemloop data not shown	materialsall enzymes were purchased from boehringer mannheim or new england biolabs and used as specifiedby the manufacturers
torr high and lowafﬁnity binding sites must be properly positioned to each other to allow tor operon induction	we next investigated whether the ability of maly to form a complex with malt depends on the nucleotide bound to malt
therefore a common structural feature of the flhdflhcbinding site has remained unknown	this differs from a model by henderson et al in that there is no downstream promoter nor is there an accessory transactivating factor 18 19
thus rece indeed functions to promote illegitimate recombination	the constitutive expression of the uida gene was strongly reduced by the simultaneous presence of the two plasmids table 5
upon the ligation of any of the dna fragments the bfa i sites are not regenerated and novel sfc i sites recognition sequence c3tpupyag are created instead	array methodology can be employed to examine gene expression under different growth conditions and this may also indirectly provide information about a regulon
in fac identiﬁcation of nucleases which may recognize contwo nuclease fractions which produced the expected	interestingly n gonorrhoeae is one of the few bacteria where recx is not found near reca 13 and n gonorrhoeae lacks an sos response 41
the molybdatedependent control of the hyc operon requires modemolybdate and moea protein 1112	when pcr was done on ip dna of the arca8myc and the wildtype strain a pcr product was seen only in the arca8myc sample fig 6c
in addition the rcsa promoter remained highly active in plasmid prcsawt despite the truncation of this sequence	ssrazsmpb complex and associated factors
it should be an essential enzyme for anaerobic growth	this work was supported in part by national institutes of health grant gm29009
the presence of intact ﬂda genes was conﬁrmed by pcr	since we found that wildtype strains of e coli are capable of secreting ﬂavins a search was conducted for proteins responsible for the secretion
the resulting recombinants were purified by cesium chloride centrifugation and used as template for rna synthesis	as crp was present in these reactions 02 mm camp was also included
in glycerol the tca cycle fluxes increased by 3070 24 and similar changes in transcript levels were observed except that glta suca and fuma increased much more about 3fold	finally sevostyanova et al 2011 show that both the bgl mutations and mutation of nusg residues that are structurally analogous to the htt motif reduce nusg s antipausing activity suggesting a conserved mechanism for interaction of rnap with nusgspt5 proteins
synthesis of dna fragments covering the paazpaaa intergenic region the target dna fragments used as probes were generated by pcr using plasmid paad as template	when annealed at the ftsk initiation codon fig 3b the primer ext1 generates a single cdna product of between 93 and 96 bp in length fig 3a
the lowmolecularweight pbps have ddcarboxypeptidase andor ddendopeptidase activity and thus bind to penicillin covalently 17	the ampliﬁed fragment was digested with xbai and bamhi and it was inserted into the xbaibamhi site downstream of the t7 promoter in pvex11
in common with other wellcharacterized integrases fimb was not impaired in dna binding by mutagenesis of this tyrosine residue	in addition we inferred through simulation that the majority of the e coli strains should have already lost the operon unless there is ongoing selective pressure to maintain it
thus these results strongly suggest that ydea promotes arabinose export out of the cytoplasm	the proteins were separated by 135 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography of the gels was performed as described previously fukuda et al 1985
more needs to be learned about the physiological function of the 6s rna rnap interaction	the supernatant was dialysed overnight against 100 vol
the gene encoding this enzyme was subcloned behind the pbad promoter to create psvd7 as described above and transformed into vdk1 pspk1 see below	the processing of the three trna substrates tested was between 20 and 37fold faster in the rne 645 strain compared with the rne 610 parent table 3 fig 3d
the effect of helpers on the t was further evaluated on a d probe targeting a more accessible site eco711 for which the td without helpers could be determined more accurately	the fosfomycin sensitivity assay gave intermediate results indicating that several of the substitutions outside the 64 element reduced uhpa binding
it might thus be informative to use immunofluorescence microscopy to investigate whether cell division was halted at any particular step during the cell division process	this procedure puriﬁed trxgadwhis6 to homogeneity based on coomassiestained sdspage data not shown
we were able to obtain an aminoterminal sequence of fragment 4 but not fragment 5 see materials and methods	the ptsg gene is transcribed from two promoters p1 and p2 separated by 141 bp plumbridge 1998
the ability in a functional sense of mg2 to saturate gacg rna tertiary structure explains the linearity of the 1tm1 versus log cation plot at low monovalentcation concentrations discussed below	for the malt preparations to be used in dnase i protection experiments the citrate salt was replaced by 03 m kci
lysogens were grown to the midlog phase of growth and cultures were assayed for alkaline phosphatase activity	it has been proposed that the second electron required to generate s2 − is donated by the oxidation of fe ii 4 to fe iii
in complementary experiments we investigated the effect of disrupting hns on nitritedependent activation of pnir	surprisingly the starting point of the αc straightening in prfa is s127 that corresponds to t127 in crp
in contrast vesicles prepared from pbadyabmtransformed cells accumulated substantial amounts of lactose that was released upon dissipation of the protonmotive force with cccp fig 2a	for the engineered icda promoter containing a fourdr site it seems likely that the afﬁnity of arcap for this site is so strong that the concentration of arcap present under aerobic conditions is sufﬁcient to occupy this site so that an o2dependent change in repression can not be observed
our binding and transcription analysis showed that dad also contains lrp binding sites for repression and activation	the resulting transformants were ara since the aact promoter mutation does not allow expression of arabad
the current was amplified with an axopatch 200b amplifier axon instruments foster city ca and filtered with a bessel filter model 900 frequency devices haverhill ma	this scenario does not agree with the findings presented here or the existing literature goto et al 2011 as described below
omission of only l11 or only l16 caused no significant reduction in binding	the majority of transductants had acquired the original pjg1 plasmid and were dark blue on xgalsupplemented k medium indicator plates however approximately 1 of the colonies were pale blue on these plates a phenotype characteristic of the staj mutant
the interaction of these cysb variants with the cysb promoter region was also unaffected by acetylserine in contrast to wildtype cysb whose binding to pcysb was inhibited by the inducer	however the deletion of the proteinacetyltransferase in both strains did not decrease the acetylation in any condition fig 5 weinert et al 2013
the c1 o1 bond of the substrate phosphate would then be split as discussed in the next section	pellicle formation is abolished in the presence of the inhibitor amethyldmannoside which is not readily metabolized by e coli 26
using these parameters 20 of the 24 most probable motif predictions 83 corresponded to previously documented tfbinding sites	this explains why rsep like all s2p proteases can cleave substrates only after they have been cleaved by a separate site 1 protease 5 69
under standard assay conditions the purified 4ftrp argrs displayed a specific activity of 17900 umg 80 of normal	for each aerobiosis value cytochrome numbers were calculated from two independent chemostat cultures biological replicates a and b biological replicate a contained na technical replicates dilutions and similarly for b ai and bi represent the individual values in a and b for different dilutions
when the culture reached an absorbance at 600 nm of 06 production of hydg was induced by adding iptg to a concentration of 01 mm	to overproduce hvrahis6 and stpahis6 proteins their structural gene was pcr ampliﬁed from genomic dna using primers introducing a ndei cloning site at the 58 end and a xhoi cloning site at the 38 end of each fragment
this places the crp binding site at 2435 bp upstream of the transcription start site rather than at 2415 bp fig 1 which is the usual location for the activator binding site at class ii crpdependent promoters busby and ebright 1997	for some strains of e coli expression of the ilvih operon is repressed about 8 to 10fold when cells are grown in the presence of leucine whereas in other strains repression is 2to 3fold 12 42
the role of crp as an activator of transcription particularly its ability to direct different kinetic mechanisms of activation from different classes of regulatory binding sites has been the subject of intense interest cf ref	each set of assays was performed at least three times in duplicate on separate occasions with similar results
the role of crp as an activator of transcription particularly its ability to direct different kinetic mechanisms of activation from different classes of regulatory binding sites has been the subject of intense interest cf ref	the sequence of the colicin s4 genes shows a mosaiclike structure fig 2 like that of other colicins 15 16 20
thus oxidation of methionine residues provides a route for scavenging hydrogen peroxide without loss of catalytic activity	the plates were incubated in a fluostar omega fluorimeter bmg labtech at 37uc and 30uc for the measurement of absorbance and at 30uc and 42uc for the measurement of the gfp fluorescence with an automatically repeated protocol
the mdoa locus of escherichia coli consists of an operon under osmotic control	in the calculated ensemble 670 of residues were in the most favored region on ramachandran plot using the software program procheck 294 were in the additionally allowed region 32 were in the generously allowed region and 04 were in the disallowed region
